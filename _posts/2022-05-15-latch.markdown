Every dbms needs a way to reserve access to a resource - whether that resource is a file, a memory page, or some other object. 
This concept is different than the concept of a lock. A lock is reserving a logical resource such as a table or row, while this is for reserving resources that are lower-level or nearly physical in nature.

## Platform Specifics
{% tabs log %}

{% tab log Db2 %}
In Db2 the terminology for this is *latch*. List latches like this:
```
db2pd -alldbs -latches
```
Note that it is rare to have to work with latches, and latching problems usually mean you're working with support to find the issue.
{% endtab %}

{% tab log Mysql %}
MySQL, the terminology for this is a *mutex*. MUtually EXclusive. List mutexes like this:
```
need to add syntax
```
Often with MySQL your goal in resolving mutex issues is to open a reproducable issue or to find the location in the code of the probelem and work around it.
{% endtab %}

{% endtabs %}
